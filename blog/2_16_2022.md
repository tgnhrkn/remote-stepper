I have finished the basic "OS" code for the stepper motor control/wifi board and the remote control. In order to simulate smooth motion the motor STEP logic must run as consistently as possible within the main loop. To achieve this I split the code into two 'directions'. In the first, a client is connected and, while they are connected, bytes are read from them. Those bytes act as commands that set a 'motor state' that determines if the motor should run. Within the connected loop, the motor run logic executes on every loop. In the second direction (no client connected), the motor run logic executes on every loop. So every loop, in theory, should run the motor and loops should execute as quickly as possible. Button presses on the motor side are captured through interrupts which makes the main loop logic simpler, just set some state and wait for the next motor logic execution to apply it.

On the remote side, the code is very simple. If a button is pressed an interrupt will set some state with a command to send. In the main loop, if a command is present in the state, the client will print it to the server. There is some overly fancy timeout logic but otherwise it is really that simple.
